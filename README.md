## Components

**Libraries Used**

   * httr
   * jsonlite
   * tidyverse
   * patchwork
   * anytime
   * testthat

**Functions Used**

   * **git_stats** - This is the main function which returns the stats of user in terms of additions, commits, deletions for the requested repository by the end user. In addition to that it also gives the option of showing visualization/trends/time series plots of additions,commits, deletions of the github user for the requested repository by the end user.

      Parameter: repo_name -> it is the repository name for which the user wants to analyze the data.

   * **adds_per_user** - It is the function which returns the stats of user in terms of additions for the requested repository by the end user. 
 
      Parameter: current_user -> the user name for which user wants to analyze the data.
 
   * **deletes_per_user** - It is the function which returns the stats of user in terms of deletions for the requested repository by the end user. 

      Parameter: current_user -> the user name for which user wants to analyze the data
      
   * **commits_per_user** - It is the function which returns the stats of user in terms of commits for the requested repository by the end user. 

      Parameter: current_user -> the user name for which user wants to analyze the data
      
   * **everything_per_user** - It is the function which returns the stats of user in terms of additions,deletions,commits for the requested repository by the end user. 

      Parameter: current_user -> the user name for which user wants to analyze the data
      
   * **adds_per_user_viz** - This shows visualization/trends/time series plots of additions of the github user for the requested repository by the end user.

      Parameter: current_user -> the user name for which user wants to analyze the data
      
   * **deletes_per_user_viz** - This shows visualization/trends/time series plots of deletions of the github user for the requested repository by the end user.

      Parameter: current_user -> the user name for which user wants to analyze the data
      
   * **commits_per_user_viz** - This shows visualization/trends/time series plots of commits of the github user for the requested repository by the end user.

      Parameter: current_user -> the user name for which user wants to analyze the data
      
   * **eveyrthing_per_user_viz** - This shows visualization/trends/time series plots of additions,deletions,commits of the github user for the requested repository by the end user.

      Parameter: current_user -> the user name for which user wants to analyze the data
      

## Tasks Done

**Team Member 1 - Navdeep Singh Saini**

   * **13th Feb** - Reasearched on the API on which the R wrapper package can be created in R and came to the conclusion that Github API should be taken into consideration
   
   * **14th Feb** - Started working on the wrapper functions for fetching the data from API for deletion and converting into the dataframe through data wrangling in R, also worked on wrapper function for creating visualizations
   
   * **15th Feb** - Worked on the common main function for user inputs and wrapping all the other functions into it, also worked on the docstring documentation of those functions
   
   * **16th Feb** - Worked on the Git Documentation of the R wrapper package
   * **17th Feb** - Worked on package testing using Circle CI and later on Github Action, after many failures we were able to run it successfully involving many changes in the configuration and even code changes.
   * **18th Feb** - Worked on rebuilding the package locally after making the changes by the vignette by other team mate and pushing it to github, also including unit testing and pushing it on github after fixing the errors in the code for the visualizations.

**Team Member 2 - Mehul Bhargava**
    
   * **13th Feb** - Worked to search for a good API, accessing it, analyzed itand finalizing it. Tried analyzing some other APIs given on the project documentation. Selected which particular API for GitHub to be selected. 
   
   * **14th Feb** - Coding for analysis of data. Extracting the data from the API in a proper format and converted into dataframes. helped creating the functions for the user requirements for commits and a combined functions. Created functions for visualizattions for commits for each user and for a combined visualization. Did faceting for the combined visualization. 
   
   * **15th Feb** - Did Error and Exception handling for the sub-function in the main function. Did some debuugging and helped in creating main function.  
   
   * **16th Feb** - Worked on GitHub documentation and package creation. 
   * **17th Feb** - Helped and worked on testing our package using GitHub actions. Helped in debugging and finally it worked.   
   * **18th Feb** - Worked on Vignettes file and did some more modifications. 


**Team Member 3 - Mayukha Bheemavarapu**

   * **13th Feb** - Started searching for possible options of API ad have shortlisted the GitHub API. Brainstormed on how to execute the project
   
   * **14th Feb** - Extracted the data from API and created functions for adds,deletes and commits per user along with visualisations. Ran the entire script on a test repo
   
   * **15th Feb** - Made the script dynamic and it can incorporate any repo. Performed exception handling and documented parts of the code
   
   * **16th Feb** - Created an R package encapsulating the scripts from above. Added the contributing, code of conduct and user_guide files
   * **17th Feb** - Debugged the issues we were facing and did continuous integration with github actions
   * **18th Feb** - Created test cases and pushed the final code to git

 **Note**: **Again to emphasise, it's perfectly running for both MAC, Windows and the latest version of Ubuntu as well. However, we are not able to figure out the exact reason for the ubuntu latest oldref version. Another important thing, our package originally was developed to take user friendly input and create outputs, but it was failing for the Github Action testing, so we changed the code with manual parameters and values.**
